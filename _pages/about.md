üßë‚Äçüéì I am a first-year PhD student at the Department of Data Science and AI, Faculty of Information and Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia, supervised by [Dr. Hao Wang](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/hao-wang). I received my Bachelor's degree in Smart Grid Information Engineering with a double degree in Mathematics from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, supervised by [Prof. Yanru Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6I1ytegAAAAJ&hl=en).

üßê My research interests are machine learning and deep learning applications in power system analysis. I am currently focusing on:

- Energy Storage Bidding
  - Battery energy storage system (BESS) joint bidding in spot and contingency FCAS markets in the context of Australian National Electricity Market -- [NeurIPS Workshop TCCML 2022](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/62); [IEEE TEMPR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19110)
  - Co-located renewable-BESS bidding
    - Wind-BESS bidding in the spot market -- [IEEE PESGM 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10253181)
    - Wind-BESS joint-bidding in the spot and regulation FCAS markets -- [EGYAI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666546823000526)
    - Solar-BESS bidding -- [IEEE TII](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10419053)
- Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Planning
  - Multi-Objective Planning Framework -- [IEEE I&CPS Asia 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10294653)
  - Review on EVCI Planning -- [Progress in Energy](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2516-1083/ad6be1)
